# Portfolio

## Creating the first version of my portfolio

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Page design and functionality

For the design I decided to go for a bento grid style, putting myself and my contact information at the center of the page and having my very first project and my current project at the top to show the evolution of my work and at the botom I have other projects worth mentioning.

For my contact section I decided to make the Icons clickable and added hover to display colors, this was more to make it look cool but it also redirects to web pages or phone/email functionality.

I made the page work well on Desktop and Mobile to ensure accessibility.
